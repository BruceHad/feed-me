				by Abbadon
Chapter: 3			
			
		
			The king on the throne, alone one day,
Took all the words in his mouth and threw them away,
First came the servants, the first of the seen,
Who built him a house, and kept his hearth clean
Next came the tall men of stone and cold fire,
To seek out all sinners and add to the pyre.
Then came the beloved, the storied and told,
The first to lay claim to the cosmos of old.
Last came the white men of bones teeth and eyes,
Who swallow all truths and spit out only lies.
 
-Children’s rhyme.

Chapter: 3			
			
		
			YISUN sat with the Attendants one day in the twentieth palace of Bone and Silver. There was a great feast laid out and YISUN directed all in attendance to forgo the custom. Black bread and spirits were served, salt was cast upon the throats of the repentant.
YISUN’S attendant IMVTTR was fond of violence and skilled in the art of separating men from their wealth and bodies. He had long hungered after the secret name of God as YISUN’s other disciple Aeshma had, but the sorry and torn sight of Aeshma’s pus weeping eyes had dissuaded him. At this feast he attempted through other means to coax some secret and dread knowledge from the universal King.
‘Oh master of masters,’ asked he, as the salt came around, and plucking absent strings upon his glyphic quorric and palming his flayer he spoke a bird into the air which sang a singular song and dissipated.
‘What is the great art known to your royal mind?’ sang the bird.
YISUN smiled in the third way for this question was anticipated for a long time.
‘Lying.’
IMVTTR spent three centuries trying to learn the equivalency of this utterance and resigned to hermitude where he went mad.
– The Song of Maybe

			YISUN sat once with his disciple Hansa in YISUN’s second clockwise glass palace. Hansa was one of his most ardent students and a grand questioner of YISUN. Unlike Yisun’s other disciple, Pree Ashma, he had no hunger in his heart for dominion of the universe, but a miserly scrutiny and a heart of iron nails. He was not an aspirant for royalty, and thereby attained it through little effort.
Hansa’s questions were thus:
‘Lord, how must I question space?’
‘With an age, an ant may encircle a giant five million times,’ spoke YISUN.
‘Lord, how then may I question time?’
‘A giant’s stride of a moment takes an ant a week to surpass.’ YISUN spoke and smiled in the 4th way.
Hansa was discontent with this answer and rubbed the stem of his long and worn pipe which he always kept with him and would eventually lead to his annihilation. Since he was royalty, he knew this, and kept it close to him as a reminder of his circular death.
‘Lord, then which should I be, the giant or the ant?’
‘Both,’ spoke YISUN,’ or either, when it suits you. Destroy the grand enemy called ‘I’.’
Hansa contemplated this in silence. Later he would recount this proverb to his daughter.

			What makes a knight?
A shining blade or bloody battered steel?
Let us name the Orders Four and the truth within reveal.
 
THE GEAS KNIGHT unknown by name, the seeker proud and true,
His endless quest hath rent the stars yet known is he by few,
THE PEREGRINE, whose bell always rings the crack of breaking day,
It’s nameless peal will drive the ceaseless evil from the ways,
THE BLOODY KNIGHT, belligerent, her edge tastes skulls and lives,
The viscera of common men and royalty besides,
THE MENDICANT, the beggar knight, roughly clad and shod,
He lives as though he were a beast, but fights he as a God.
– Children’s Rhyme.

			ii. The lie of the iron plum
There was once a king named UN-Payam who sat at the right hand of YISUN’s throne and ruled a palace of burnished gold and fire and dispensed justice in all things. It was let known once that Payam had grown an extraordinary plum – enormous in size, with adamant skin that was burnished as a breastplate and fifty times as hardy. Payam was desirous of a pillow friend of fiery heart and excellent skill with their mouth and let know that whosoever could break the skin of that plum with their teeth he would swear to share his bed with for three nights in whatever disposition they may desire.
Many gods were in attendance at Payam’s hall on the first day, and even more on the second day, but by the third day of this strange contest few remained who had not tested their mettle, for the plum remained implacable and immaculate and turned many away with sore teeth and roiling frustration in their brains. A great cry rose up and YISUN was called forth from the twenty third clockwise palace of carbon where YISUN had been meditating on the point of a thirty acre long spear of crystallized time. In companionship with YISUN was Hansa, who followed along.
“See this Payam!” cried the gods, “He deceives us! He cruelly abuses our lustful hearts!”
YISUN was very fond of plums and immediately grasped the iron plum and took a long, succulent bite, praising its merits to the amazement of all.
“How!” wailed the attended.
“Why, it is a plum of flesh, and quite ripe as well,” said YISUN plainly, and indeed, it was apparent to those gathered that it was the case. The plum was passed around and touched and indeed it was sensual and soft and pliant. Hansa was not so convinced. “It is still a plum of iron,” said he, “there is some trickery here, oh master of masters.”
“Indeed, it is so,” said YISUN, and it was again apparent to those gathered that the flesh of that plum was as hard and impermeable as a fortress. “How can it be so?” said Hansa, “How comes this fickle nature? Plums and the fifty winds are not so alike I think.”
YISUN said, “I told you of this and, believing it, it was so. We are all secret kings of our own tower. In truth, it is whichever you prefer. In truth, there is no plum at all, just as there is no YISUN.  A plum has no shape, form, or color at all, in truth, but these are all things I find pleasing about it. A plum has no taste at all for it has no flesh or substance, but I find its sweetness intoxicating. A plum is a thing that does not exist. But it is my favorite fruit.”
“A pipe is a thing that does exist, and it is my favorite past time,” said Hansa, lacking understanding, and growing in cynicism.
“What a paradox!” said YISUN, smiling, “I shall share my love tenderly with Payam.”

iv. The lie of the small light
Hansa was of sound mind and proud soul and only once asked YISUN a conceited question, when he was very old and his bones were set about with the dust and bent with age. It was about his own death.
“Lord,” said Hansa, allowing a doubt to blossom, “What is ending?”
It was said later he regretted this question but none could confirm the suspicion.
“Ending is a small light in a vast cavern growing dim,” said YISUN, plainly, as was the manner.
“When the light goes out, what will happen to the cavern?”
“It and the universe will cease to exist, for how can we see anything without any light, no matter how small?” said YISUN. Hansa was somewhat dismayed, but sensed a lesson, as was the manner.
“Darkness is the natural state of caverns,” said he, vexingly, “if I were a cavern, I would be glad to be rid of the pest of light and exist obstinately anyway!”
“Hansa is observant,” said YISUN.

			“Do you understand the true power of a sovereign? A raw man must kill with his bare hands. The battered warrior, a weapon. The commander, his bellowing voice, the conspirator, a whispered word. But all these pale compared to kingship. A true sovereign need not flex a single muscle in his body, and a hundred men die. A true sovereign may murder without a single impulse, or even intent, sight, breath, or even though of his murder. He is an idiot indifferent to his own violence. He has sublimed the act of obliteration.
That is the meaning of kingship.”
AU VAM, Pankrator of the Yellow City
