    <link>http://killsixbilliondemons.com/</link>
    <description>This is a webcomic! It’s graphic novel style, meaning it’s meant to be read in large chunks, but you can subject yourself to the agony of reading it a couple pages a week!</description>

			YISUN on the conquering king:
A conquering king must come with violence in his self of selves. He must splay the guts of his enemy with no weapon but his hearstrings. His lips must spit sweet music that pulverizes his enemies, and his eyes must tell a brain-cleaving tale of loveliness. He must quench the sword of his tongue in the love of his enemies.
Spasms 31:12

			KSBD 1-9
			
				by Abbadon
Chapter: 1			
			
		
			On the night of the 88th Marquis, YISUN queried his servants that were gathered in the hall of the Glass Temple of the 90th water. “Where shall we resolve this tale of the one we have not met yet?” said YISUN, and smiled in the 3rd way.
The servant Nighzmarquls, who was recitant said:

“The key is set, unlock the veil and show her the firmament of all things. Take her to the truth of unclothed and let its glory burn her.”
The servant Gordon was eager to please YISUN and said:

“The third eye has been burnt into the flesh, mind and soul of one unready. Like a tea party with the rug pulled out from under it, reality would alternately crumble and shatter, but this mind lacks the breadth to see it for what it is, so would see nothing at all, until the pieces settled into a new order, and the nothingness resolved itself into something else.”
The servant Driftwood, who had arrived late to the gathered, cast off his suggestion:

“Apparently she is going to the distant future.”
YISUN was pleased for he saw these were good things, and made it so.
